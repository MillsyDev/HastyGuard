            <div class="faq-content">
                <p><b>Primary Data:</b></p>
                <p>Question 1: Pick two primary data collection methods and design a process to collect marketing data.</p>
                <p><b>Survey:</b> Helps identify customer needs and preferences to improve targeted marketing strategies.</p>
                <p><b>Experimentation:</b> Investigating insurance types customers prefer and their ethical expectations helps optimize pricing strategies.</p>
                <p><b>Secondary Data:</b></p>
                <p>Question 1: Investigate data on your industry or location.</p>
                <p>The professional services industry grew by 19.8% in 2020-2021.</p>
                <p>Question 2: How will two pieces of data influence your marketing decisions?</p>
                <p>We need to maintain competitive pricing while ensuring a good profit margin to keep up with industry growth.</p>

       <div class="faq-section">
    <h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">Marketing Mix</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Explain how you will use one of product positioning, product branding OR product packaging to gain a competitive advantage within your market segment.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> I will aim to position this product as a middle-of-the-range insurance and will position ourselves as a good middle ground between the big brands and the smaller insurance companies. We will gain advantage through capitalizing on the customers that do not want to pay the outlandish prices at other insurances.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Choose two pricing strategies for your product, and explain how these relate to your identified business profile.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> At HastyGuard, we use price skimming to help keep an edge on competitors and create a more affordable price. We also use specific quoting to ensure that we keep a profit whilst giving the best prices. We can't give that price to everyone, as there are more risky customers with a higher chance of needing the insurance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Draw a chart to illustrate the distribution channel that your business will use and explain why the channel choice that you will use is appropriate for your product, focusing on at least two reasons.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The distribution channel for HastyGuard looks like this: HastyGuard —> Customer. This channel ensures that we are directly dealing with the customer we think we are. If we did it through a third party, there is a greater chance that someone will be signed up to a cheap deal and have a bad history. This direct channel is also appropriate because insurance is a personal service. People prefer their details not to be shared, and being direct ensures that we are the only ones with access to our customers’ data, which helps with data security.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Analyze how your business will use one of the major elements of promotion to inform, persuade, and remind your target market about your product.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hasty Guard will do a publicity stunt through ads and social media. We will create a memorable ad featuring graveyard sites with the message, 'This could be you if you don't use HASTY GUARD.' The ad will direct people to a spoof site, hatchthosecaskets.store, with a tagline, 'Look at this rip-off. Just live with HASTY GUARD.' This will remind people of HastyGuard whenever they think of risks, boosting interest in our company.</p>

<div class="faq-section">
    <h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">Customer Relation Strategies</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Propose and justify a customer relations strategy that will provide a positive outcome for your business and the customer, with reference to the Pareto principle (80:20 rule).</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> At HastyGuard, we will propose a customization option so that people can get the perks they want without all the other bells and whistles. Proposing this will create stronger customer loyalty as there will be a clearer distinction between us and other competitors. This will, in theory, create an 80:20 scenario where 80% of revenue will come from 20% of the most popular insurance benefits. This benefits us by reducing the need to pay out for unnecessary or unwanted services, thus lowering the potential for losses.</p>

        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Discuss the significance of one corporate social responsibility (CSR) issue that a business needs to address when establishing a customer base.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> One major corporate social responsibility issue is ethical practices and human rights. Businesses need to address this because many customers are likely to avoid companies that mistreat or undermine employee rights. While ethics is one of the most basic and monitored CSR components, it remains essential. Failing to address ethical concerns can not only harm sales but also expose the business to legal risks, as violating human rights is illegal and may have serious ramifications for the company’s reputation and operations.</p>
